# Embedded Systems Overview

Embedded systems are computer systems designed for specific functions within a larger system or product. They are commonly found in automotive systems, medical equipment, consumer electronics, and industrial control systems. There are various types of embedded systems, including standalone, real-time, networked, mobile, wireless, and hybrid systems.

When developing embedded systems, there are different options available, such as bare metal programming, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and embedded general-purpose operating systems (GPOS). Embedded Linux, a type of GPOS, is commonly used in embedded systems due to its flexibility, reliability, and customization capabilities.

## QEMU and Raspberry Pi for Embedded Linux Development

`QEMU (Quick EMUlator)` is an open-source virtual machine emulator and virtualizer that can simulate various hardware architectures and platforms. It is useful for testing, development, and debugging of embedded Linux systems. QEMU allows emulation of target hardware platforms on a host machine, facilitating development when physical hardware is unavailable or difficult to access. It also enables cross-compilation and simulation of different hardware configurations.

`Raspberry Pi` is a series of low-cost, single-board computers based on ARM processors. It runs on Linux-based operating systems like Raspbian and Ubuntu and offers multiple input/output interfaces for connectivity. Raspberry Pi is widely used in education, automation, media centers, and IoT applications.

QEMU and Raspberry Pi can be combined to enhance embedded Linux development. QEMU can emulate Raspberry Pi hardware, enabling testing and debugging of embedded Linux systems in a virtual environment. It also supports cross-compilation, allowing code development on a different machine and running it on Raspberry Pi using QEMU. Additionally, QEMU's customization capabilities enable testing on different Raspberry Pi models and hardware configurations.

## Mounting a Raspberry Pi Image in Ubuntu using QEMU

To mount a Raspberry Pi image in Ubuntu using QEMU, follow these steps:

1. Install QEMU using the command: `sudo apt-get install qemu`.
2. Download a Raspberry Pi image compatible with the desired version.
3. Create a copy of the image to avoid damaging the original.
4. Convert the image to a format compatible with QEMU using `qemu-img`.
5. Use the `qemu-system-arm` command to mount the image and start the emulated Raspberry Pi.
6. Mount the image in Ubuntu using the `mount` command.
7. Access and modify the mounted image's contents as needed.
8. Remember to unmount the image before shutting down the emulated Raspberry Pi to prevent data corruption.

## Unmounting a Raspberry Pi Image in Ubuntu using QEMU

To unmount a Raspberry Pi image that has been mounted in Ubuntu using QEMU, follow these steps:

1. Ensure no programs or applications are accessing the mounted image.
2. Navigate to the mount point directory in a terminal.
3. Use the `umount` command with the appropriate mount point to unmount each partition.
4. Once all partitions are unmounted, shut down the emulated Raspberry Pi with the `shutdown` command.
5. Exit the QEMU window by pressing Ctrl + Alt + 2, then entering the `quit` command in the QEMU monitor.
